# Project: Landing Page

## Description:
The first project of The Odin Project Foundation Course, where the goal was to create a landing page using pure HTML and CSS based on a provided design. The project serves as the final task of the HTML and CSS foundation course, recapping all the fundamental skills taught throughout the course.

This project marks my first step in the world of web development, and I look forward to creating more projects in the future.
